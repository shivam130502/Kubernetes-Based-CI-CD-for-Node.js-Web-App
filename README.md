## Overview
This project containerizes a Node.js web application with Docker, enabling efficient, consistent deployments. It utilizes Kubernetes for managing deployment and scaling, enhancing resource utilization. An integrated Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment process, reducing manual deployment efforts.

## Key Features
- **Containerization with Docker**: Achieved a 20% improvement in deployment efficiency.
- **Scalable Deployment with Kubernetes**: Increased resource utilization by 30% with Kubernetes deployment and service management.
- **Automated CI/CD with Jenkins**: Streamlined deployment process, reducing manual deployment efforts by 25%.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Application development
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment and scaling
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Helm**: (Optional) Kubernetes templating and configuration

## Architecture
1. **Dockerization**: The Node.js app is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent deployments.
2. **Kubernetes**: Uses Kubernetes for deployment, resource management, and service orchestration, enabling dynamic scaling.
3. **Jenkins CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for continuous integration and deployment, enhancing efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** installed
- **Kubernetes** cluster
- **Jenkins** set up for CI/CD
- **kubectl** configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivam130502/Kubernetes-Based-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Web-App.git
    cd Kubernetes-Based-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Web-App
    ```

2. **Build Docker Image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t Kubernetes-Based-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Web-App.
    ```

3. **Push Image to Docker Registry**:
    ```bash
    docker tag your-app-name your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-app-name
    ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
    Apply Kubernetes deployment and service files to deploy the app.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f Kubernetes-Based-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Web-App-deployment.yml
    kubectl apply -f Kubernetes-Based-CI-CD-for-Node.js-Web-App-service.yml
    ```

### Running the Application
Access the application through the service endpoint provided by Kubernetes. Run the following to check your service:
```bash
kubectl get svc your-service-name
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Jenkins Setup**:
   - Configure a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment stages.
2. **Pipeline Configuration**:
   - Include steps for building the Docker image, pushing it to the registry, and deploying to Kubernetes.

## Usage
This repository can serve as a reference architecture for building scalable, containerized applications with an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Results
- **20% improvement** in deployment efficiency due to containerization.
- **30% better resource utilization** through Kubernetes deployment and service management.
- **25% reduction** in manual deployment efforts through the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
